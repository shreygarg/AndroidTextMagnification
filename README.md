An android application that I made in the final year of my college as part of my Btech Project. It uses image processing algorithms to magnify and clarify an image and allows us up to 16x digital zoom with a normal phone camera. OpenCV has been used as the image rocessing library. This application was make to assist visually impaired individuals who requir text to be enlarged to read. If coupled with a simple stand, this has the potential to replace very expensive apparatus which is currently used by visually impaired individuals to read or for general text magnification purposes.
